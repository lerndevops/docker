Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP) provides a robust interface for managing your Docker applications in a cluster. In this lesson, we will introduce UCP and demonstrate the process of setting up a basic UCP cluster with one manager and two worker nodes.

Lesson Reference
To complete this lesson, you will need three playground servers. All should have Docker EE installed.

UCP Manager
Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver LTS
Size: Large
UCP Worker with DTR
Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver LTS
Size: Medium
UCP Worker
Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver LTS
Size: Small
On the UCP Manager server, Pull the UCP image.

docker image pull docker/ucp:3.1.5
Set a temporary environment variable containing the private IP address of your UCP manager server.

PRIVATE_IP=<your UCP manager private IP>
Run the UCP installer.

docker container run --rm -it --name ucp \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  docker/ucp:3.1.5 install \
  --host-address $PRIVATE_IP \
  --interactive
When prompted, create some admin credentials.

You will also be prompted for Additional Aliases. When this happens, just hit Enter to accept the default value.

Once the installation is complete, access UCP in a web browser using the UCP manager's Public IP address: https://<your UCP manager public IP>.

Log in to the UCP manager using the credentials you created earlier.

You will be prompted to provide a license:

Open another tab and go to https://hub.docker.com/my-content.
Click Setup.
Download the license using the License Key link.
Go back to the UCP tab and click Upload License. Select the license file you just downloaded and upload it.
In your browser, on the UCP dashboard, click Shared Resources, Nodes, then Add Node.

Make sure the Node type is Linux and the Node role is Worker. Then, copy the docker swarm join command that appears on the page.

Run the docker swarm join obtained from the UCP manager on both worker nodes.

If you go to Shared Resources, then Nodes on the UCP dashboard in your browser, you should see both worker nodes appear in the list.
