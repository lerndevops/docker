Which command do you use to create a new swarm?
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>
2. What is this flag --advertise-addr for?
This flag configures the IP address for the manager node and The other nodes in the swarm must be able to access the manager at the IP address.
3. How do you know the current status of the swarm?
docker info // you can find the info under the swarm section
4. Which command do you use to find the information about the nodes in the swarm?
docker node ls
5. How to add another manager to the swarm?
// it generate the instructions for the manager to be added
docker swarm join-token manager
6. How to add another worker node to the swarm?
// it generate the instructions for the worker to be added
docker swarm join-token worker
7. How to run the container?
docker run <image>
8. What is the autolock feature in the Docker swarm?
When Docker restarts, both the TLS key used to encrypt communication among swarm nodes, and the key used to encrypt and decrypt Raft logs on disk, are loaded into each manager node’s memory.
Docker 1.13 introduces the ability to protect the mutual TLS encryption key and the key used to encrypt and decrypt Raft logs at rest, by allowing you to take ownership of these keys and to require manual unlocking of your managers. This feature is called autolock.
9. How to lock the swarm?
// This command produces unlock key. You need to place that in safe place
docker swarm init --autolock
10. How to unlock the swarm?
docker swarm unlock
11. Are we able to enable autolock feature only when we create a swarm for the first time?
No. You can lock the existing swarm as well
12. How to enable or disable autolock on the existing swarm?
//enable autolock
docker swarm update --autolock=true
//disable autolock
docker swarm update --autolock=false
13. How to view the current unlock key for the running swarm?
docker swarm unlock-key
14. How to rotate the unlock key?
docker swarm unlock-key --rotate
15. If the key was rotated after one of the manager nodes became unavailable and if you don’t have access to the previous key you may need to force the manager to leave the swarm and join it back as a new manager. Is this statement correct?
Yes

22. How to find out more details of the container running these tasks of the service?
// you need to run this command on the particular node
docker ps
23. If you are running co-related services in the docker swarm, what do you call this?
stack
24. What is Docker stack?
A stack is a group of interrelated services that share dependencies, and can be orchestrated and scaled together.
25. Explain the several commands associated with Docker stack?
// deploy the new stack or update
docker stack deploy -c <compose file>
// list services in the stack
docker stack services
// list the tasks in the stack
docker stack ps
// remove the stack
docker stack rm
//List stack
docker stack ls
26. How to filter the services in the stack?
// with the help of --filter flag
docker stack service nginx-web --filter name=web 
27. How to format the output of the docker stack services command?

// example
docker service scale frontend=50
// you can scale multiple services as well
docker service scale frontend=50 backend=30
// you can also scale with the update command
docker service update --replicas=50 frontend
29. How to revert the changes for the service configuration?
docker service rollback my-service
30. What are the networks available for the docker services?
overlay networks: manage communications among the Docker daemons participating in the swarm.You can attach a service to one or more existing overlay networks as well, to enable service-to-service communication.
ingress network: is a special overlay network that facilitates load balancing among a service’s nodes. When any swarm node receives a request on a published port, it hands that request off to a module called IPVS. IPVS keeps track of all the IP addresses participating in that service, selects one of them, and routes the request to it, over the ingress network.
docker_gwbridge: is a bridge network that connects the overlay networks (including the ingress network) to an individual Docker daemon’s physical network.
31. Is the ingress network created automatically when you initialize or join a swarm?
Yes
32. Is docker_gwbridge network created automatically when you initialize or join a swarm?
Yes
33. How to create an overlay network?

// you can customize it
 docker network create \
  --driver overlay \
  --subnet 10.0.9.0/24 \
  --gateway 10.0.9.99 \
  my-network
34. How to inspect the network?
docker network inspect my-network
35. How to attach a service to an overlay network?
docker service create \
  --replicas 3 \
  --name my-web \
  --network my-network \
  nginx
36. Can service containers connected to the overlay network communicate with each other?
Yes
37. How to find which networks the service is connected to?
docker network inspect my-network
               or
docker service ls // for the name
docker service ps <SERVICE> // to list the networks
38. Customize the ingress network involves removing and creating a new one and you need to do that before you create any services in the swarm. Is this statement correct?
Yes
39. How to remove and create an ingress network?
docker network rm ingress
docker network create \
  --driver overlay \
  --ingress \
  --subnet=10.11.0.0/16 \
  --gateway=10.11.0.2 \
  --opt com.docker.network.mtu=1200 \
  my-ingress
40. What is the difference between -v and --mount flags in terms of creating volumes?
Originally, the -v or --volume flag was used for standalone containers and the --mount flag was used for swarm services. However, starting with Docker 17.06, you can also use --mount with standalone containers. In general, --mount is more explicit and verbose.
41. How to create a service with volume?
docker service create -d \
  --replicas=4 \
  --name devtest-service \
  --mount source=myvol2,target=/app \
  nginx:latest
42. Does docker service create command supports -v or — volume flag?
No
43. What are the volume drivers?
When building fault-tolerant applications, you might need to configure multiple replicas of the same service to have access to the same files.
Volume drivers allow you to abstract the underlying storage system from the application logic. For example, if your services use a volume with an NFS driver, you can update the services to use a different driver, as an example to store data in the cloud, without changing the application logic.
44. How to create a volume with the volume driver?
docker volume create --driver vieux/sshfs \
  -o sshcmd=test@node2:/home/test \
  -o password=testpassword \
  sshvolume
45. How to create a service with volume driver?
docker service create -d \
  --name nfs-service \
  --mount 'type=volume,source=nfsvolume,target=/app,volume-driver=local,volume-opt=type=nfs,volume-opt=device=:/var/docker-nfs,volume-opt=o=addr=10.0.0.10' \
  nginx:latest
46. I created a deployment that runs exactly one task on every node. which type of service deployment is this?
global
47. I created a deployment that runs several identical tasks on nodes. which type of service deployment is this?
replicated
48. If you want to troubleshoot the UCP clusters what is the best method?
it's always best practice to use client bundle to troubleshoot UCP clusters
49. What is the general flow when troubleshooting services or clusters?
docker service ls
docker service ps <service>
docker service inspect <service>
docker inspect <task>
docker inspect <container>
docker logs <container>
50. How to update metadata about a node?
you can use labels to add metadata about the node
51. How to add a label to the node?
docker node update --label-add foo worker1
// add multiple labels
docker node update --label-add foo --label-add bar worker1
52. How to remove the label from the node?
docker node update --label-rm foo worker1
53. How to set up the service to divide tasks evenly over different categories of nodes?

// example: if we have three datacenters 3 replicas will be placed on each datacenter
docker service create \
  --replicas 9 \
  --name redis_2 \
  --placement-pref 'spread=node.labels.datacenter' \
  redis:3.0.6
53. How to limit your service on particular nodes?
--constraint
// example: the following limits tasks for the redis service to nodes where the node type label equals queue
docker service create \
  --name redis_2 \
  --constraint 'node.labels.type == queue' \
  redis:3.0.6
54. Which algorithm does the docker engine use when it is in swarm mode to manage the global cluster state?
Raft Consensus Algorithm
55. What is a quorum and why it is important?
Quorun ensure that the cluster state stays consistent in the presence of failures by requiring a majority of nodes to agree on values.
Raft tolerates up to (N-1)/2 failures and requires a majority or quorum of (N/2)+1 members to agree on values proposed to the cluster.
without quorun swarm wont be able to serve the requests
56. What are the supported flags for creating services with templates?
--env
--mount
--hostname
// example
service create --name hosttempl \
    --hostname="{{.Node.Hostname}}-{{.Node.ID}}-{{.Service.Name}}"\
      busybox top

COPY [--chown=<user>:<group>] <src>... <dest>
The COPY instruction copies new files or directories from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path <dest>.
74. What is ENTRYPOINT instruction in the Dockerfile?
An ENTRYPOINT allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable.

// run the container
docker export <container> > single-layer.tar
docker import /path/to/single-layer.tar
// check the history
docker image history
103. Each layer is only a set of differences from the layer before it. The layers are stacked on top of each other. Is this statement about the image correct?
Yes
104. When you create a container It adds one writable layer on top of all the layers of the image. Is this statement about the image correct?
yes
105. What is the copy-on-write (CoW) strategy?
Copy-on-write is a strategy of sharing and copying files for maximum efficiency. If a file or directory exists in a lower layer within the image, and another layer (including the writable layer) needs read access to it, it just uses the existing file. The first time another layer needs to modify the file (when building the image or running the container), the file is copied into that layer and modified. This minimizes I/O and the size of each of the subsequent layers.
106. How to customize the registry while deploying?
// customize published port

// for example you have a configuration like this for root directory
storage:
  filesystem:
    rootdirectory: /var/lib/registry
// you can create environment variable like this
REGISTRY_STORAGE_FILESYSTEM_ROOTDIRECTORY=/somewhere
it will change from /var/lib/registry to /somewhere

144. If the swarm loses the quorum of managers it loses the ability to perform management tasks. Is this statement correct?
Yes
145. If the swarm loses quorum all the existing tasks and services are all deleted. Is this statement correct?
No. All the existing tasks will continue to run. But, new nodes cannot be added and new tasks can't be created.
146. We should use a fixed IP address for the advertise address to prevent the swarm from becoming unstable on machine reboot. Is this statement correct?
Yes. If the whole swarm restarts and every manager node subsequently gets a new IP address, there is no way for any node to contact an existing manager. Therefore the swarm is hung while nodes try to contact one another at their old IP addresses.
147. You should maintain an odd number of managers in the swarm to support manager node failures. Is this statement correct?
Yes.
148. I have manager nodes 3, 5, 7, 9. How do you distribute these manager nodes on availability zones so that If you suffer a failure in any of those zones, the swarm should maintain the quorum of manager nodes
Manager Nodes           Availability Zones
    3                     1-1-1
    5                     2-2-1
    7                     3-2-2
    9                     3-3-3
149. How to drain the node

150. How to cleanly rejoin a manager node in the cluster?
1. To demote the node to a worker, run docker node demote <NODE>
2. To remove the node from the swarm, run docker node rm <NODE>
3. Re-join the node to the swarm with a fresh state using docker swarm jo
151. How to forcibly remove a node?
docker node rm --force <NODE>
152. If you want to remove a manager node you need to demote it to a worker role first. Is this statement correct?
Yes. You must ensure that there is a quorum
153. What is the location where swarm managers save the swarm state?
/var/lib/docker/swarm
154. How to backup the swarm?

  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  \
  docker/ucp:2.2.22 restore --passphrase "secret" < /tmp/backup.tar
168. You need to backup the UCP on the single manager node since Docker maintains the same UCP state in all the manager nodes. Is this statement correct?
Yes
169. How to backup the DTR?
To perform a backup of a DTR node, run the docker/dtr backup command.
170. DTR requires that a majority (n/2 + 1) of its replicas are healthy at all times for it to work. So if a majority of replicas are unhealthy or lost, the only way to restore DTR to a working state is by recovering from a backup. Is this statement correct?

184. What are all the different built-in network drivers?
Bridge Network Driver
Overlay Network Driver
MACVLAN Driver
Host
None
185. What are the Bridge network and its use case?
The bridge driver creates a private network internal to the host so containers on this network can communicate.
The bridge driver does the service discovery for us automatically if two containers are on the same network
The bridge driver is a local scope driver, which means it only provides service discovery, IPAM, and connectivity on a single host.
186. What is the scope of the bridge network?
local
187. What are the Overlay network and their use case?
The built-in Docker overlay network driver radically simplifies many of the complexities in multi-host networking.
It is a swarm scope driver, which means that it operates across an entire Swarm or UCP cluster rather than individual hosts.
188. What is the scope of the overlay network?
swarm
189. What are the MACVLAN network and their use case?
The macvlan driver is the newest built-in network driver and offers several unique characteristics. 
It’s a very lightweight driver, because rather than using any Linux bridging or port mapping, it connects container interfaces directly to host interfaces.
190. What is the scope of the macvlan network?
local
191. What are the Host network and its use case?
With the host driver, a container uses the networking stack of the host. There is no namespace separation, and all interfaces on the host can be used directly by the container.
192. What is the scope of the host network?
local
193. What are the None network and its use case?
The none driver gives a container its own networking stack and network namespace but does not configure interfaces inside the container. Without additional configuration, the container is completely isolated from the host networking stack.
194. What is the scope of the None network?
local
195. The Docker networking architecture is built on a set of interfaces called the Container Networking Model (CNM). Is this statement correct?
Yes
196. What is a sandbox in the CNM model?
A Sandbox contains the configuration of a container's network stack. This includes the management of the container's interfaces, routing table, and DNS settings. An implementation of a Sandbox could be a Windows HNS or Linux Network Namespace, a FreeBSD Jail, or other similar concept. A Sandbox may contain many endpoints from multiple networks.
197. What is an endpoint in the CNM model?
An Endpoint joins a Sandbox to a Network. The Endpoint construct exists so the actual connection to the network can be abstracted away from the application. This helps maintain portability so that a service can use different types of network drivers without being concerned with how it's connected to that network.
198. What is a network in the CNM model?
The CNM does not specify a Network in terms of the OSI model. An implementation of a Network could be a Linux bridge, a VLAN, etc. A Network is a collection of endpoints that have connectivity between them. Endpoints that are not connected to a network do not have connectivity on a network.
199. What part of the Docker that provides the actual implementation that makes networks work?
Network Drivers
200. What is IPAM drivers?
Docker has a native IP Address Management Driver that provides default subnets or IP addresses for the networks and endpoints if they are not specified.
201. How to configure docker to use external DNS?

221. What is the role?
A role is a set of permitted API operations that you can assign to a specific subject and collection by using a grant
222. What is a Client Bundle?
A client bundle is a group of certificates downloadable directly from the Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP) user interface within the admin section for “My Profile”. This allows you to authorize a remote Docker engine to a specific user account managed in Docker EE, absorbing all associated RBAC controls in the process. You can now execute docker swarm commands from your remote machine that take effect on the remote cluster.
223. What is the easiest way to access or control the UCP?
Client Bundle
