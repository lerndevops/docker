Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) is an enterprise-ready private registry which includes additional features that are not available with a free private registry. In this lesson, we will introduce DTR. We will also demonstrate how to set up a Docker Trusted Registry within your UCP cluster.

Lesson Reference
In the Universal Control Plane interface, go to admin, Admin Settings, then Docker Trusted Registry.

Under UCP Node, select the worker node where you want to install DTR.

Check the checkbox labeled Disable TLS verification for UCP.

Copy the command provided on the page, then use a text editor to change the --ucp-url to specify the Private IP of the UCP Manager server, not the public IP.

Run the modified command on the worker node where you want to install DTR. The command should look like this:

docker run -it --rm docker/dtr install \
  --ucp-node 172.31.8.89 \
  --ucp-username admin \
  --ucp-url https://172.31.7.61 \
  --ucp-insecure-tls
When prompted for a password, enter your UCP admin password.

Once the installation is complete, access DTR in your browser at https://<DTR server public IP>.

Log in using your UCP admin credentials.
