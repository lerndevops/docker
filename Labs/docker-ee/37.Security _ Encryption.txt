Docker is built with safety in mind and comes with a wide variety of security features. In this lesson, we will discuss some important aspects of Docker's internal security that must be kept in mind when using Docker, as well as at the time of taking the Docker Certified Associate exam.

In a distributed model, such as the one used by Docker Swarm, it is important to encrypt communication between nodes to prevent potential attackers from obtaining sensitive data from network communications. In this lesson, we'll discuss the two ways that Docker Swarm utilizes for securing cluster communication. We'll also cover how to encrypt overlay network communication to secure the communication between containers within the cluster, and we'll discuss how Docker Swarm uses Mutually Authenticated Transport Layer Security (MTLS) to encrypt and authenticate cluster-level communication.

Lesson Reference
Create an encrypted overlay network:

docker network create --opt encrypted --driver overlay my-encrypted-net
Create two services on the encrypted overlay network and demonstrate that one service can communicate with the other:

docker service create --name encrypted-overlay-nginx --network my-encrypted-net --replicas 3 nginx
docker service create --name encrypted-overlay-busybox --network my-encrypted-net radial/busyboxplus:curl sh -c 'curl encrypted-overlay-nginx:80 && sleep 3600'
Check the logs for the busybox service, and then verify that it shows the Nginx welcome page:

docker service logs encrypted-overlay-busybox
