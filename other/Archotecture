Docker architecture:
	•	Client-server architecture
	•	Client talks to the Docker daemon
	•	The Docker daemon handles:
	◦	Building
	◦	Running
	◦	Distributing
	•	Both communicate using a REST API:
	◦	UNIX sockets
	◦	Network interface
The Docker daemon (dockerd):
	•	Listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects:
	◦	Images
	◦	Containers
	◦	Networks
	◦	Volumes
The Docker client (docker):
	•	Is how users interact with Docker
	•	Sends commands to dockerd



===================


Docker engine:
	•	Modular in design:
	◦	Batteries included but replaceable
	•	Based on open-standards outline by the Open Container Initiative
	•	The major components:
	◦	Docker client
	◦	Docker daemon
	◦	containerd
	◦	runc
	•	The components work together to create and run containers
A Brief History of the Docker Engine
The first release of Docker:
	•	The Docker daemon:
	◦	Monolithic binary
	◦	Docker client
	◦	Docker API
	◦	Container runtime
	◦	Image builds
	◦	Much more...
	•	LXC:
	◦	Namespaces
	◦	Control groups (cgroups)
	◦	Linux-specific
Refactoring of the Docker Engine
LXC was later replaced with libcontainer:
	•	Docker 0.9
	•	Platform agnostic
Issues with the monolithic Docker daemon:
	•	Harder to innovate
	•	Slow
	•	Not what the ecosystem wanted
Docker became more modular:
	•	Smaller more specialized tools
	•	Pluggable architecture
Open Container Initiative:
	•	Image spec
	•	Container runtime spec
	•	Version 1.0 release in 2017
	•	Docker Inc. heavily contributed
	•	Docker 1.11 (2016) used the specification as much as possible
runc:
	•	Implemenation of the OCI container-runtime-spec
	•	Lightweght CLI wrapper for libcontainer
	•	Create containers
containerd:
	•	Manages container lifecycle
	◦	Start
	◦	Stop
	◦	Pause
	◦	Delete
	•	Image management
	•	Part of the 1.11 release



==================


Creating a container:
	•	CLI use for executing a command
	•	Docker client uses the appropriate API payload
	•	POSTs to the correct API endpoint
	•	Docker deamon receives instructions
	•	Docker deamon calls containerd to start a new container
	•	Docker daemon uses gRPC (a CRUD style API)
	•	containerd creates an OCI bundle from the Docker image
	•	Tells runc to create a container using the OCI bundle
	•	runc interfaces with the OS kernal to get the constructs needed to create a container
	◦	This includes namespaces, cgroups, etc.
	•	Container process starts as a child process
	•	runc exits once the container starts
	•	Process is complete, and container is running
